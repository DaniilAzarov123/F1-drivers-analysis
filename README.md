# Formula 1 DNF Prediction Dataset (1950–2024)

## Overview

This project explores Formula 1 race data (1950–2024) to predict Did Not Finish (DNF) outcomes — cases where drivers fail to complete a race due to mechanical issues, crashes, disqualifications, or other factors.

The goal is to identify key predictors of race completion and evaluate the performance of several machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset combines:
- Race results
- Driver performance metrics
- Team information
- Circuit characteristics
- Historical context

It provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing performance, safety, and reliability trends in Formula 1 over more than seven decades.

## Methods

I applied several classification models to predict whether a driver finishes a race or records a DNF, comparing their performance using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.

| Model              | AUC  | Accuracy |
|--------------------|------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.94 | 86.9% |
| Random Forest       | 0.97 | 91.4% |
| XGBoost             | 0.98 | 92.6% |

## Key Insights

- **Starting position** is a strong predictor of finishing probability.
Drivers starting near the front of the grid are more likely to finish, possibly because rear cars are exposed to more on-track incidents.
- **Year of the race** also matters.
Finish rates have steadily improved over time, likely due to stricter safety regulations, technological advances, and better car reliability.
